# IT28X17 – Honours: Information Security Risk Analysis  
**University of Johannesburg**

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **Information Security Risk Analysis Tool**, developed as part of the IT28X17 Honours module. The tool is designed to help users evaluate their risk profile based on a given case study or scenario.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Risk Analysis Tool empowers users to:

- 🔍 **Identify and list potential threats**  
- ⚠️ **Assess the likely impact** of each threat  
- 📈 **Estimate the likelihood** of threat occurrence  
- 🧮 **Calculate total risk scores**  
- 🛡️ **Determine residual risk** after applying countermeasures  
- 🗂️ **Record and manage countermeasures**

This tool may be initially implemented in **Microsoft Excel** and further developed into a standalone application. It must reflect the student's own insight into risk-related conditions and factors to produce meaningful risk results.
